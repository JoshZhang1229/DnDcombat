Dungeon exploration thing
By Josh Zhang
2020.06.14
Added the basics. Basic exploration and combat has been added
Dealt with annoying bug where maxhp kept changing to match hp (healing pool)
some functionality where the player actually gets some input
where the encounters avalible change as your explore further and further
weapon pickup, perks/skill, more encounters

Ty C.G.!!!
wishlist: weapon pickup, peak/skill pickup, a second combat encounter, shops, food, gold, dialog

2020.06.15
Squash all bugs
Make sure all variables get used at least once
-
weapon pickup
perks
combat narrated turn by turn
-

2020.06.27
Some major shifts on the back end for combat.
Shifted away from it's D&D orgins to be more a story based game.
The front end user experience hasn't changed much.
However the final objective this game has.
